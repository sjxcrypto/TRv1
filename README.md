# TRv1

**High-performance sovereign L1 blockchain built on SVM**

TRv1 is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain forked from the [Agave](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave) Solana validator client. It preserves the raw throughput of the Solana Virtual Machine while replacing the consensus layer, economic model, and hardware requirements to create a more accessible and sustainable chain.

## Key Features

### ⚡ SVM Parallel Execution Engine
Forked from the battle-tested Agave validator. Full Solana program compatibility with parallel transaction execution via Sealevel.

### 🔒 Tendermint-Style BFT Consensus
Replaces Proof-of-History (PoH) with deterministic-finality BFT consensus. Blocks are final once committed — no probabilistic confirmation windows.

### 💾 Tiered Storage Architecture
Dramatically reduced hardware requirements compared to Solana's 512GB RAM baseline. TRv1 validators can run on commodity hardware starting at 32GB RAM.

### 💰 Flat 5% Staking Rewards
Per-coin annual yield (not fixed inflation). Every staked coin earns 5% per year regardless of total stake, funded by controlled emission with a hard supply cap.

### ⏱️ Tiered Passive Staking
Lock tokens for longer to earn more yield and governance voting weight:

| Lock Tier | % of Validator Rate | Effective APY | Vote Weight |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| No lock   | 5%                | 0.25%         | 0x (no vote)|
| 30 day    | 10%               | 0.50%         | 0.10x       |
| 90 day    | 20%               | 1.00%         | 0.20x       |
| 180 day   | 30%               | 1.50%         | 0.30x       |
| 360 day   | 50%               | 2.50%         | 0.50x       |
| Delegator | 100%              | 5.00%         | 1.00x       |
| Permanent | 120%              | 6.00%         | 1.50x       |

Early unlock penalties: 5× the tier's reward rate (e.g., 30-day = 2.5% penalty). Permanent lock has no early unlock.

### 🔥 EIP-1559 Style Fees with 4-Way Split
Dynamic base fee with a 4-way split that transitions over 5 years:

| Recipient | Launch | Maturity (Year 5) |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 🔥 Burn | 10% | 25% |
| ✅ Validator | 0% | 25% |
| 🏦 Treasury | 45% | 25% |
| 👨‍💻 Developer | 45% | 25% |

All percentages governance-adjustable. Transition is linear per epoch.

### 🏛️ 200 Active Validator Soft Cap
Active set capped at ~200 validators for performance, with unlimited standby validators ready to rotate in. Promotes decentralization without sacrificing throughput.

### 🛡️ Validator-Only Slashing
Delegators are **never** at risk of slashing. Only validators face penalties for equivocation or downtime. This removes the single biggest barrier to casual staking participation.

### 🧑‍💻 Built-in Developer Rewards
Smart contract deployers automatically receive 10% of all fees generated by their programs. No grants needed — ship code, earn revenue.

## Hardware Requirements

| Tier | RAM | CPU | Storage | Use Case |
|------|-----|-----|---------|----------|
| **Lite** | 32 GB | 8 cores | 500 GB NVMe | Standby validator, RPC node |
| **Standard** | 64 GB | 16 cores | 1 TB NVMe | Active validator |
| **Performance** | 128 GB | 32 cores | 2 TB NVMe | High-throughput validator, archival |

> **Note:** These are dramatically lower than Solana's recommended 512GB RAM / 24+ cores, thanks to TRv1's tiered storage architecture and BFT consensus reducing memory pressure.

## Architecture

TRv1 retains the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) execution layer — including Sealevel parallel scheduling, the BPF/SBF program runtime, and the accounts database — while replacing the consensus and economic layers:

| Layer | Solana/Agave | TRv1 |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Consensus** | Proof-of-History + Tower BFT | Tendermint-style BFT |
| **Finality** | ~12.8s (probabilistic) | Instant (deterministic) |
| **Execution** | SVM / Sealevel | SVM / Sealevel (same) |
| **Min RAM** | 512 GB | 32 GB |
| **Staking Yield** | Variable (inflation-based) | Flat 5% per-coin |
| **Slashing** | Validators + Delegators | Validators only |
| **Fee Model** | Priority fees | EIP-1559 + 4-way split |
| **Dev Incentives** | Grants only | Automatic fee sharing |
